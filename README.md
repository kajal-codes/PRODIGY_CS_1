# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption

## 📖 Overview  
This repository contains a **Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher**, a simple yet effective encryption technique.  
The program allows users to **encrypt and decrypt** messages using a shift-based substitution method.  

## ✨ Features  
✅ Encrypts text by shifting letters based on user input  
✅ Decrypts text by reversing the shift  
✅ Allows users to specify the shift value  
✅ Simple command-line interface  

## 🏗️ How It Works  
The **Caesar Cipher** is a substitution cipher that shifts each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  
For example, with a shift of **3**, the letter **A** becomes **D**, **B** becomes **E**, and so on.  

- **Encryption:**  
Original: HELLO
Shift: 3
Encrypted: KHOOR


- **Decryption:**  
Encrypted: KHOOR
Shift: 3
Decrypted: HELLO
